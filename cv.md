## Code example

DESCRIPTION:
>Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer. Correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:
>  - _S_ is misinterpreted as _5_
>  - _O_ is misinterpreted as _0_
>  - _I_ is misinterpreted as _1_

SOLUTION:
```
const correct = string => string.replace(/0/g, 'O').replace(/1/g, 'I').replace(/5/g, 'S');
```
